Problem Statement:
You are a database administrator. You want to use the data to answer a few
questions about your customers, especially about the sales and profit coming
from different states, money spent in marketing and various other factors such as
COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), budget profit etc. You plan on using these insights
to help find out which items are being sold the most. You have been provided
with the sample of the overall customer data due to privacy issues. But you hope
that these samples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to
help answer the questions.
